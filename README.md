Grid based simulation in rust  
  
This is an attempt to
* Implement an understood and pre-existing program in idiomatic rust style 
* Provide neighbor-determination and state change conditions as abstractions through closures
* Experiment with animation techniques

The hope is to get more familiar with rust while creating a modular grid-based simulation and visualization engine.
The engine happens to default to Conway's Game of Life.

## Installation/Compilation notes
Currently there are no external dependencies and everything should compile under the latest nightly.
